## üîÑ Deploy to Vercel

To deploy this project to Vercel, follow these steps:

### 1. Add Environment Variables

After deploying, navigate to **Vercel > Project Settings > Environment Variables** and add the necessary environment variables for production.

Replace all occurrences of `localhost` with your Vercel domain URL, as shown below:

```plaintext
KINDE_SITE_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/
KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/dashboard

```

These variables ensure that the app functions properly on your Vercel deployment.

### 2. Initialize and Deploy

Run the following command to initialize the deployment:

```bash
vercel
```

This command will prompt you to configure the project for the first time if it hasn't been linked to Vercel.

Once configured, deploy the project to production using:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will push your latest changes live on Vercel.
